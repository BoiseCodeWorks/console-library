# Console-Library

Diving into the world of C# can be overwhelming... So let's build a checkout system for a couple of our favorite books.

This will be a console app that will provide users a choice of books to checkout. Because we have a limited supply of books you will limit the books that a user can check out at a time to 1. With this rule in mind users need a way to check a book back into the library. 

```terminal
Select a Book to Checkout:

1. HeadFirst with C#
2. Mastering the Console App
3. C# Game Programming: For Serious Game Creation
4. Pro C# 5.0 and the .NET 4.5 Framework
5. Return Book

Select the Book you would like to checkout by number: 
```
